## Overview
A simple site I created to help me do quick running based conversions and calculations when developing my training plan.

Try it out at [running-calculator.io](http://running-calculator.io/)


Perceived effort is a subjective measure of how hard someone feels like they are working during physical activity, such as running. It is influenced by factors such as the intensity of the exercise, the individual's level of fitness, and their psychological state.

## Background and Motivation

As a runner that travels between the US and Canada frequently, I have found that I have had to do metric-imperial conversions often during my training. Some are simple, i.e distance but some are a bit challenging like 'mm:ss/mile' to 'mm:ss/km' or mph. Also, as I've been training treadmills quite often, having a tool that converts treadmill speed with incline to approximate 'on ground speed' is quite useful.

## Key Features

1. Distance Conversion
2. Speed/Pace Conversion
3. Pace, Time & Distance Calculation
4. Treadmill to On Ground Speed Conversion

## Goals

1. Deploy a web app with all the key features above
2. Add in race prediction feature (i.e 1500m time ==> estimated 5000m time)
3. Improve the UI


## Milestones

### :white_check_mark: Phase 1 :
Develop the basic web app for basic conversions

### :white_square_button: Phase 2 :
Add in race predition and improve UI
