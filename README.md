# Running Calculator

## Overview
A simple site I created to help me do quick running based conversions when develpoing my training plan.

Try it out at [randompasswordgenerator.io](https://random-password-generator.io/)

## Background and Motivation

I found that I was often prompted to come up with complex password combinations when creating new accounts for on various sites. I decided to create my own simple web app that randomly generated a password as well as a helpful mneumonic to help in remembering the password. 

To enhance the functionality, I plan to configure a pipeline that can call one of the Text-to-Image APIs to produce a unique image with the password string.

## Goals

1. Deploy a web application for quick km to miles.
2. Create a way to convert treadmill metrics to real world metrics.

## Practical Applications

- Help individuals quickly create and remember complex passwords

## Milestones

### :white_check_mark: Phase 1 :
Develop the web app to randomly generate passwords based on custom parameters

### :white_square_button: Phase 2 :
Configure a pipeline that can call one of the Text-to-Image model APIs to produce a custom image for each ranomly generated password.
